Car Rental
An online tool for companies to list their cars for rent and people to rent cars.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


Prerequisites
Before starting you need to have the database up and running also if you are testing it in a local environment, a local server is required (xampp or something else).

Installing

First install the xampp (if in local environment), next on your xampp folder/htdocs paste or clone the project.

Second comes the database, open phpMyAdmin on localhost and create a database with a name you want to use, open that database and import the file from the project folder/web-car-rental.sql. This will create all the tables needed.

If you want to change anything (username,password,...), you can find the connection string in project folder/db_connect.phpMyAdmin
